rsa
===

C code to generate RSA keypairs as well as encrypt/decrpyt messages

File names should give away what each one's prupose is. Uses the OpenSSL BIGNUM library. Generates 512-bit primes used
for message encryption and decryption. Currently conversion of messages from text to numbers for encryption is not
supported.
